#+TITLE: Property Base Your State Machine (WIP)
#+AUTHOR: Sean Chalmers, Jack Kelly

random amusing slide idea(s):

- building applications:
  - Expectation: obedient working dog
  - Reality: chtulu

topics to cover from conference submission:
* Introduction to property-based testing
  - Unapologetic
  - Unexpected
  - Enlightening
  - Empowering
  - hands off the mundane aspects to the computer

* How it applies to state-machine testing
  - retain PDD benefits
  - still allows the mundane part to be fobbed off to the computer

* What state-machine offers
  - See "building applications"
  - lifts benefits of having & knowing properties from entire functions to entire processes  (!bigdeal!)
  - can aid in larger design decisions by making state/transitions explicit

* Some cool examples of applications of state-machine testing
  - direct ((our)coffee machine/turnstile)
  - external (wordpress/webdriver)
  - gimmicky (water jug problem - http://clrnd.com.ar/posts/2017-04-21-the-water-jug-problem-in-hedgehog.html)
