#+TITLE: Property Base Your State Machine
#+AUTHOR: Sean Chalmers, Jack Kelly
#+EMAIL:

* Programs are weird
  Complex, Dependent, Interactive, Insidious

* Testing weird is hard
  - manual testing? =[cries in Quality Assurance]=
  - which processes do you test?
  - test for failure?

* Cost : Benefit
  - multi-step testing can be arduous and brittle
    - input and process are static
    - coverage
    - new feature? have fun!

* Do what we can
  - eat the cost for some big things
  - write unit tests for some small things
  #+BEGIN_SRC haskell
    getLunch "fishy" == TunaSalad
    getLunch "spicy" == HalfChicken ExtraHot
  #+END_SRC
  - subcontract end users to suggest regression tests

* Property-based awesome
  - unleash the power of: $\forall$
  - shrinking
  - powerful design tool
    - =forAll text= becomes =forAll lunchType=

* Property-based state machine testing
  Property-based testing, lifted to the level of *application behaviour*.
  
** Generate structured inputs
   randomised inputs for actions

** Generate workflows
   define actions independently, let the package generate workflows

** Shrinking (OMG!)
   you thought shrinking was cool before...

** Useful feedback
   a failure will produce:
   - the sequence of actions
   - their respective inputs
   - the random seed responsible

* OMG
  Right?

* Moving parts

** Model
   track expectations/awareness regarding the 'state' of the world

** Command
   - pre & post conditions
   - generator
   - executor
   - model update function
   Represents the /transitions/, not the states.

** Given
   [[./images/mach.png]]

** Test this
   [[./images/mach_transitions.png]]

** Not this
   [[./images/mach_states.png]]

* Machines that grow
  new feature ~ new Command(s)

* Examples?
  - Wordpress API (a tiny bit of it)
  - LevelDB

* Come to the workshop!
  Learn the weirding way!

* Bonus Round
 Use classification to understand your test-case distribution
