# Level 04 - Positive & Negative Testing

In a previous level you implemented commands with pre-conditions to ensure they
are only run when it is appropriate. However this only tests the 'positive' path
within the application. To be thorough we need to check what happens if we
execute a command when the 'ideal' requirements have not been satisfied.

In this level you will write commands to ensure both the positive and negative
paths are tested.
